“My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
   Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
   Over the path of the poor orphan child.

Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
   Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
   Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan child.

Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
   Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
   Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
